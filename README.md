# Mini Sticker Online Store

This is a mini online store project for stickers. I created this project to improve my understanding of Redux. The project is built using React, Redux, JSON Server, and Vite.

## Description

This project simulates an online store for stickers. It uses Redux for state management and JSON Server as a mock backend to simulate API interactions. Due to the lack of hosting and server resources, the project cannot be viewed online. To use the project, you'll need to clone the repository and run it on your local machine.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
